# Structurizr for .NET

This GitHub repository is a .NET library to create software architecture models that are compatible with [Structurizr](https://structurizr.com), a SaaS to create web-based software architecture diagrams. It's an implementation of the "C4 software architecture model", as described in Simon Brown's FREE [The Art of Visualising Software Architecture](https://leanpub.com/visualising-software-architecture) book. In a nutshell:

1. Create a software architecture model using .NET code, either manually or by extracting information from an existing codebase.
1. Upload the model (as a JSON document) to [Structurizr](https://structurizr.com) using the web API.
1. Visualise and share the resulting software architecture diagrams ([example](https://structurizr.com/public/1)).
